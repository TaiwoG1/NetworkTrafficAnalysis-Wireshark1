<h1>Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project demonstrates practical experience with Wireshark, a leading network protocol analyzer, to capture, filter, and inspect network communications. The objective was to analyze the fundamental components of web (HTTP) traffic generated during a common user action: downloading a file from a web server.
<br />
<br />
<h2>Key Activities & Skills Demonstrated:</h2>

- <b2> Traffic Capture: Initiated a live packet capture session in Wireshark. </b2>
- <b2> Traffic Generation: Generated HTTP traffic by navigating to a specified URL and downloading a file from a web browser. </b2>
- <b2> Capture Management: Successfully stopped the capture to focus on relevant data. </b2>
- <b2> Filtering & Analysis: Applied display filters (e.g., http) to isolate HTTP protocol messages. </b2>
- <b2> Packet Inspection: Analyzed individual packets in the Packet-Listing window, identifying key HTTP request/response methods (e.g., GET), source/destination IP                 addresses, and TCP segment details. This provided insight into the layers of the TCP/IP model during a web transaction.

<b>Outcome:<br/>

<b2>This lab reinforced my ability to effectively use Wireshark for network troubleshooting, security monitoring, and understanding protocol-level communications, confirming proficiency in network analysis fundamentals.</b2>
